# Choose Your Own Adventure: Saint Louis Cemetery #1

Choose Your Own Adventure: Saint Louis Cemetery #1 is an interactive story, inspired by the popular book series, with the user assuming the role of the main character. 
The user is presented with various choices that dictate the story and the plot's outcome. The story's conclusion is based on a system of 'moral points', based on a user's choice between two actions, and 'items collected', collected through specific substory plots, which translate into either a good, neutral, or bad ending.

The story itself was inspired by the author's trips to New Orleans and personal interest in the horror genre.
